description: As part of the "Deutsche Romantik Museum" project we created an interactive
  web experience. The application is based on the same data set as one of the
  main exhibits in the museum and explores the whereabouts of over 30 protagonists
  of european romanticism.
  I did the implementation back to front using statamic cms, next.js and tailwind.
  For the interactive map using leaflet.js and a custom set of map tiles served
  by an self-hosted tile server.
