description:
  As part of the web team at Onoff I contributed in the development and maintenance of the
  onoff web client. Users could login with their Onoff account and do phone calls
  and send SMS directly from the browser. Other features of the web client included a synced contact book,
  voicemail feature, account settings and CRM integrations.<br>
  In my role I implemented new features, refactored legacy code, did code reviews and contributed
  to design discussions.
