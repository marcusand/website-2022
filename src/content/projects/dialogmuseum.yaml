description: As part of the project team I implemented a digital guestbook and a POI system
  for the museums foyer.
  Both are react and electron based applications with custom hardware and
  input devices attached. Being a museum covering the topic of blindness,
  the digital guestbook has text to speech and voice recording abilities. For the
  kiosk system in the foyer I did the integration of a photo booth feature as well
  as a donation system with contactless payment.
