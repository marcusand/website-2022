description: As part of the project team I participated in the implementation
  of an interconnected show room experience. Visitors are handed
  tablets by which they can scan nfc tags to get certain information
  or control wall screen applications in the exhibition.
  All clients in the exhibition are interconnected and communicate via MQTT and a node-RED backend.
