description:
  As part of the web team in Onoff I lead the development of the Click2Call chrome extension.
  What previously just existed as a MVP codebase, we decided to redo from scratch and over the course
  of a few month brought it to the first release with excellent user feedback. The extension enabled
  phone number highlighting and a click to call functionality on any website the user is on. <br>
  In my role as a lead developer I set the foundation for the architecture, implemented features, did
  code reviews and actively contributed to design decisions.
