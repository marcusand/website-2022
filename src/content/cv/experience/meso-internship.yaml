description: Got insights in a variety of different projects over the course of
  this internship. While learning a lot, I also did some active contribution
  to some of these projects. This included writing a microservice in node.js,
  updating and fixing an existing ruby on rails application and developing a touch interface
  for an exhibit.<br>
  After 6 months of working as an intern, I was asked to stay on as a working student.
