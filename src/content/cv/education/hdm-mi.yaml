description: Applied computer science program with a focus on user-centric software and
  multimedia technologies. Over the course of the program I set my
  focus on software development and web technologies.
  My thesis I created in cooperation with MESO, in which I evaluated the
  use of web technologies in the context of kiosk and point of information
  systems.
