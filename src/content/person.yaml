description: <p>Hi, I'm Marcus!</p>
  <p>
  I am a software developer with a focus on frontend development, user interfaces and multimedia technology.<br>
  I know the web stack inside and out, especially frontend technologies such as React, Redux, Electron, Next.js & CSS.<br>
  Apart from that I have a general interest in UX, an eye for good design and a guitar always near to my desk.

  For the last few years I have developed web apps, interactive exhibits and backend systems mainly for exhibitions and showrooms. Here you can see a selection of projects I most recently worked on.
