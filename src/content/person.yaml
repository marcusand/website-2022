description: <p>Hi, I'm Marcus!</p>
  <p>
  I am a software developer with a passion for frontend development, user interfaces and multimedia technology.
  I love working on human-centered software and creating the best user experience possible.<br>
  I know the web stack inside and out, especially frontend technologies such as React.js, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, Electron.js, JS, HTML & CSS.<br>
  Apart from that I have a strong interest in UX, an eye for good design and a guitar always near to my desk.

  For the last few years I have mainly developed web apps, interactive exhibits and backend systems for museums and showrooms. Here you can see a selection of projects I most recently worked on.
