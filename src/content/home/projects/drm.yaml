description: <p>
  I was part of the project team creating an exhibition consisting of
  more than 30 digital exhibits and a complete backend structure
  with a cms and deployment pipeline.

  My main focus in the project was on implementing a handful of
  interactive exhibits and a software for video playback.
  All software was written using web technologies (react + redux + nw.js).
