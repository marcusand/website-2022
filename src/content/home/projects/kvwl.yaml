description: <p>
  As part of the project team I participated in the implementation
  of an interconnected show room experience. Visitors are handed
  tablets by which they can scan nfc tags to get certain information
  or control wall screen applications in the exhibition. All tablets
  and exhibits are in the same exhibition network and
  communicate via mqtt with each other and a node-red backend.
